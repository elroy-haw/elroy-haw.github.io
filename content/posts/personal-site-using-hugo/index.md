## What is Hugo? 
According to the [README](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo), Hugo is a static HTML and CSS website generator written in Go. It takes a directory with content and templates, renders them into a full HTML website. This is basically a dream come true for someone like me who cannot be bothered with writing frontend code, and just want whatever written in some text (in this case markdown), to appear nice enough on the website.
